# PHSX815_Project1
My code and LaTeX file for project 1 of PHSX 815

## PHSX815_Project1
This file contains the python code for the project.

### MySort.py
This contains the sorting methods that may be used for this lab. I'm thinking of maybe adding a few more to suit my needs.

### Random.py
This file contains the random number generator as well as the random number distributions that will be used. Additional distribution may need to be programed to create the distrubtions I need for this project.

### Proj1_Read+Plot.py 
This contains the code that will create the random numbers and random number distributions. It is heavily influenced by the code that Dr. Rogan shared with us in the course.

### Proj1_Gen+Write.py
This contains the code that will read in the random number distributions and plot them. This is mostly based on the work that we did for HW 4.
